Ad√¶pt is a platform for portfolio development, aimed at creatives that want to showcase their work as a story and a process.


# Start
1. npm install in both root directory and client directory
2. Add keys_dev.js file to config folder ( mongo uri + mongo secret)



Scheduled Fixes
1. MongooseError: The `uri` parameter to `openUri()` must be a string, got "undefined". Make sure the first parameter to `mongoose.connect()` or `mongoose.createConnection()` is a string.
2. Module not found: Can't resolve './ProfileGithub' in 'C:\Users\code4\Projects\Ad-pt\client\src\components\profile'
